## To-Do
1) All the registration page contents should be kept in a separate php file. Break up
   the code into separate components, preferably in file specific to registration page.

2) Index.html should use sessions/cookies, etc to redirect the user to the
   appropriate page. It should not contain any UI/frontend stuff

3) The home pages (user information & class tabs) should be broken into components
   to enable the creation of dynamic webpages catered for users/teachers respectively.

4) The UI of the registration page should be improved. The about and contact section
   should be moved to the footer instead of the header.

5) Evaluate the best method to perform a page redirection

6) To explore on the model view controller design pattern to make the code more
   readable and efficient

### Note:
* (3) is a suggestion because I lack knowledge on how to create dynamic webpages.
