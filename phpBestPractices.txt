1) Always use single quotes for strings

   PHP will automatically escape single quote characters in strings with single quotes,
   meaning that the programmer will not have to worry about sql injections.

2) Always sanitize and filter form inputs using

    htmlspecialchars($str)
    filter_var($str, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);

3) Understand the differences between include, include_once, require, require_once

    include - Includes a php file and re-includes the file on subsequent requests.

    include_once - Includes a php file only once. Works across different php files.
    
    require - Same as include except execution of script is halted if 
              script is not found.

    require_once - Same as require and include_once.

4) Split up large html code into different php files for modularity.

   Adv: Common php files can be cached on the client side, reducing need to
        make redundant requests to server.

5) Use PDO instead of mysqli to interact with databases.

   Adv: PDO provides a unified data access abstraction layer, meaning that it
        can work with different databases whereas mysqli can only work with
        mysql database.

6) If a script has executed once, the states of all global variables are saved in
   the web server until the next restart. Take advantage of this caching mechanism
   to optimise website performance on subsequent requests to the file.
